========

What's jNerator ?

It's a framework to generate Java POJOs based on custom configuration to easy the burden of starting new projects.

jNerator uses Reflection to read and write into objects attributes, dealing with collections, primitives, wrappers, arrays and complex types (a.k.a another objects).
